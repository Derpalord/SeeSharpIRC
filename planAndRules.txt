General rules
    - Use understandable variable and function names, so something like clientMain() is fine but cm() isn't.
    - Comment yer code, we're both autistic in near-opposing directions so our understanding of "obviously readable and and intelligible code" may wildly differ.
    - TBD

Plan
    - I don't fucking know lmao, we just start with something I guess.
